# Predicting Whether a Bank Client will Subscribe for a Term Deposit

### Problem Description/Objectives : 
ABC Bank wants to sell its term deposit product to customers and before launching the product, they want to develop a model which helps them in understanding whether a particular customer will buy their product or not (based on customer's past interaction with bank or other Financial Institution).


### Approach:
To predict whether a customer will subscribe for a term deposit, we will use the following techniques:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Logistic Regression
* Machine Learning Methods (Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network)

### Results
According to the results of the Logistic Regression Model, clients are **more likely to subscribe for a term deposit** if :
* The outcome of the previous campaign was successful
* It is the month of March, October, September, or December (from most likely to least likely)
* They are contacted by cell phone
* They are retired or a student

According to the results of the Logistic Regression Model, clients are **less likely to subscribe for a term deposit** if:
* It is the month of January, November, August, or July (from least likely to most likely)
* Method of contact is unknown
* The outcome of the previous campaign was a failure or unknown
* The client has a housing loan or personal loan
